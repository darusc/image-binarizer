# 1. IGNORE THE BUILD FOLDER
# This single line ignores the .xpr, .runs, .cache, .gen, .sim, etc.
# because we configured the Tcl script to put them all inside here.
binarizer/

# Vivado creates these in the folder where you run the script.
*.jou
*.log
*.str
*.zip
*.os

# Prevent accidental committing of generated checkpoints or bitstreams
# if they are created outside the build folder.
